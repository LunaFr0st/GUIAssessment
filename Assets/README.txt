Layout
	I am going to have my layout as a minimalistic style menu, this will give it a clean and modern look to it which may intrigue players to play the game.
	The Menu will have the minimalistic look similar to Deceit (Survival Horror Game) but will have the logo off centered to the right with the Buttons on the left.
	The Options menu will follow the similar look to the Main menu and have minimal amount of buttons to make it easier for the end user.
	The Main menu will have a Side Expander which will contain News and Upcoming DLC Pages.
	
	The pause menu will have a carousel style to it following the Minimalist theme of the main menu, each page of the pause menu (Options, Save/load etc.) will circle around to allow you to access it
	when the pause menu is active the screen will get a black tint to it to allow the user to know they are in the pause menu if they arent looking directly at it.
